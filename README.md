# Applications-Bot

If you're looking to do applications but don't want to purchase a whole website, don't want to spend a lot of money on a developer to do a commission then this is the perfect bot for you. 
Right now it only accepts one application but you can add/remove as many questions and responses as you wish. 

## Requirements. 
1. node.js
1. A Discord Account
1. PC
1. You do not need a hosting provider, but I suggest one. https://snowsidehosting.com
1. A small Brain

If you got any questions then join the support server. https://discord.gg/ksv9GaZJ74
